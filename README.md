# Pith & Reverie

**Soft truths. Real weight.**

Pith & Reverie is a personal blog space for reflection, storytelling, and quiet creativity.  
Built to be slow, thoughtful, and grounded — a corner of the internet for anyone holding both chaos and calm.

## About the Project
Pith & Reverie is not a loud space. It’s a slow one.
