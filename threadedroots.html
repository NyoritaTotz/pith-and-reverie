    <h2>Threaded Roots</h2>
    <p>I don’t write to be understood by everyone. I write to remember who I am.  
    This space is rooted in growth, grief, joy, and soft power — a place to unpack the weight of being human.</p>

      <h3>How I Ended Up in Learning the Tech Industry</h3>

      <p>It wasn't a straight road.  
      It wasn't even a paved one.</p>

      <p>When I first imagined my life, it didn’t include lines of code or late nights debugging servers.  
      It was quieter — a life built around words, stories, and quiet service.</p>

      <p>I started as a Legal Assistant.  
      Administrative work.  
      Helping people navigate systems too complex for most.</p>

      <p>But somewhere along the way, I realized:  
      I wasn't just following paths — I wanted to build them.</p>

      <p>The systems I worked inside of often felt broken. Slow. Heavy.  
      And while I loved the human side of my work, I kept bumping into the same walls:  
      <em>"It’s just the way it is,"</em> people would say.  
      Something in me never sat well with that.</p>

      <p>Technology whispered a different story.  
      A story where change was possible.  
      Where you could build tools instead of battling broken ones.  
      Where you didn’t have to wait for permission to fix what needed fixing.</p>

      <p>At first, it was small: teaching myself basic HTML to tweak a website.  
      Curiosity turned into courses.  
      Courses turned into projects.  
      Projects turned into late nights where "just one more line" became whole worlds built from scratch.</p>

      <p>I realized the work I loved most — the work that felt both joyful and weighty — lived at the intersection of people and systems.  
      And if I wanted to make systems better for real people, I had to learn how they were built.</p>

      <p>So I chose to start over.  
      Back to being a beginner.  
      Back to messy first steps.  
      Back to school — this time for Software Engineering.</p>

      <p>Today, when I write a line of code, I'm not just solving a problem.  
      I'm leaving a breadcrumb for someone else who might walk a little lighter because of it.</p>

      <p>This isn’t the career I planned.  
      It’s the career I grew toward.</p>
